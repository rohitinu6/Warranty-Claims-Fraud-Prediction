# Warranty Claims Fraud Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent warranty claims using machine learning techniques. The goal is to identify and prevent fraudulent claims to reduce financial losses.

## 🚀 Features

- Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Fraud detection using machine learning models
- Feature engineering and selection
- Model evaluation and optimization

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset includes:

- **Customer Information**
- **Warranty Claim Details**
- **Claim Amount**
- **Product Details**
- **Fraudulent or Legitimate Label**

## 📊 Machine Learning Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Gradient Boosting
- Neural Networks

## 🔥 Results

The models are evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The best model helps in flagging fraudulent claims effectively.
